<h1>HACKING</h1>
<h2>FACT VERSUS FICTION</h2>
<p>Back	in	2007,	famed	NYPD	Detective	John	McClane	was	facing	the	toughest	battle	of	his life	-	at	least	up	until	that	point.	Used	to	physical	confrontations	and	playing	cat-andmouse	with	flying	bullets	and	shattering	windows,	he	was	taken	aback	when	he	was suddenly	faced	with	one	of	the	most	amazing	acts	of	terrorism	in	recent	movie	memory. He	was	fighting	a	genius	capable	of	controlling	anything	from	traffic	lights	and	cellphones to	the	stock	market,	military	aircraft,	and	the	NSA. Of	course,	the	Die	Hard	franchise	is	not	one	to	deal	with	magic	and	the	occult	-	so	these remarkable	feats	are	explained	as	the	work	of	a	group	of	elite	computer	hackers,	perhaps the	best	in	the	world	that	even	the	US	Government	could	not	match.	And	as	viewers,	we tend	to	enjoy	those	scenes	when	a	seemingly	omnipotent	opponent	falls	to	the	clutches	of a	tenacious	protagonist. However,	this	can	also	mean	that	we	are	willing	to	suspend	out	judgment	of	what	is possible	and	what	is	not.	And	in	Live	Free	or	Die	Hard,	the	stellar	hacking	performance	is nothing	short	of	mere	fantasy.	In	real	life,	hackers	have	a	much	less	glamorous	(and infinitely	more	difficult)	time	tinkering	with	technological	roadblocks. But	if	Hollywood	has	led	you	to	believe	that	hacking	is	all	adrenaline-rush,	then	there’s still	something	for	you.	History	shows	that	the	Government	had	indeed	been	hacked	once	and	about	$1.7-million	dollars’	worth	of	software	vital	to	the	integrity	of	the	International Space	Station’s	physical	environment	has	been	compromised.	Moonraker,	anyone?
The	juvenile’s	name	is	Jonathan	James	-	and	yes,	he	was	only	16	years	old	when	he accomplished	this	momentous	feat.	Earlier,	he	had	also	targeted	one	of	the	Defense	Threat Reduction	Agency	servers,	directly	monitored	by	the	Department	of	Defense.	These servers	work	to	mitigate	threats	to	America	and	its	ally	nations	in	cases	of	nuclear, biological,	chemical,	and	even	conventional	warfare.	The	backdoor	he	set	up	allowed	him to	access	sensitive	emails,	stealing	employee	usernames	and	passwords	in	the	process. James’s	ISS	exploits	caused	NASA	to	shut	down	its	computer	systems.	He	set	a	record	for being	the	first	juvenile	sent	to	jail	for	hacking.	In	his	defense,	he	said	that	he	only downloaded	the	code	to	help	in	his	studies	of	C	programming	-	even	dismissing	the	code as	“crappy”	and	“certainly	not	worth	$1.7	million”.
In	response,	the	Government	gave	him	a	6-month	house	arrest	as	well	as	a	ban	on recreational	computer	use.	He	violated	parole,	for	which	he	spent	six	months	in	jail. Because	no	matter	how	great	a	hacker	you	are,	you	cannot	hack	into	the	legal	system. Another	thing	that	the	movies	love	portraying	is	that	hackers	are	mostly	either	disgruntled members	of	society	holed	up	in	their	basements	or	MIT-level	geniuses	in	the	employ	of the	Government	(or	some	malevolent	villain).	Whatever	the	personification,	these	people are	shown	equipped	with	state-of-the-art	hardware	and	software	that	seems	to	be	almost always	themed	in	black,	white,	green,	and	blue.	Just	to	show	that	fact	can	be	stranger	than fiction,	enter	Adrian	Lamo,	the	“homeless	hacker”	who	uses	coffee	shops	and	libraries	to do	“unofficial”	(and	criminal)	penetration	testing	for	Microsoft,	The	New	York	Times, Yahoo!,	Bank	of	America,	Cingular,	and	Citigroup.	Aside	from	a	genius	IQ	in	hacking, pretty	much	all-else	he	has	is	a	laptop	and	a	change	of	clothes. Oh,	and	he	was	also	fined	$65,000,	and	sentenced	to	half	a	year	of	home	confinement.	His two-year	probation	ended	last	2007.</p>
