<h2>INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h2>
<ul>
<h3>TYPES OF INFORMATION SYSTEMS</h3>
<li>
Information system is a system that uses the resources of people, hardware, software and telecommunications to perform input, output, process, storage and control activities that convert data into information. Basically, information systems support operations, decision-making and strategic advantage.  Information systems roles have expanded overtime.

               <h4>NEED OF A SYSTEM</h4>
Information systems are needed to support production of information for decision-making in performance of activities.  Information systems then depend on information needed and activities supported.
To perform activities, organizations have established organizational structures depicting managerial levels and functions. For these functions and levels there are different information needs and information systems. Information in these structures has to flow within an organization in a way that will help managers, and the organization, achieve their goals. To this end, organizations are often structured horizontally and vertically-horizontally to reflect functions and vertically to reflect manage¬ment levels.
                  <p>Functions</p>
Organizations are divided into functions which consist of processes that consist of activities.  Staff could be assigned to one or more activities.  Such a staff could have supporting computer, software and data. An output of one activity could be an input of another.  No doubt, systems performing the activities are networked thus resulting in computer networks.
Depending on the services or products they provide, most organizations have functions or departments that perform five functions: research and development (R&D), production, marketing, accounting and finance, and human resources (personnel). Information systems are designed so as to provide the information needed by the specific department.  Each function or department tends to have an information system named after it.  For instance, marketing function would to have marketing information systems. This should apply to the functions described below.
Research and development: The research and development (R&D) department does two things: 
	<li>It conducts research, relating discoveries to the organization's current or new products.</li> 
	<li>It does product development and tests and modifies new products or services created by researchers.</li> Special software programs are available to aid in these functions.
Production: The production department makes the product or provides the service. In a manufacturing company, it takes the raw materials and has people or machinery turn them into finished goods. In many cases, this department uses CAD/CAM software and workstations, as well as robotics. In another type of company, this department might manage the purchasing, handle the inventories, and control the flow of goods and services. 
Marketing: The marketing department oversees advertising, promo¬tion, and sales. The people in this department plan, price, advertise, promote, package, and distribute the services or goods to customers or clients. The sales reps may use laptop computers, cell phones, wireless e-mail, and faxes in their work while on the road.
Accounting and finance: The accounting and finance department han¬dles all financial matters. It handles cash management, pays bills and taxes, issues paychecks, records payments, makes investments, and compiles financial statements and reports. It also produces financial budgets and forecasts financial performance after receiving informa-tion from other departments.
Human resources: The human resources, or personnel, department finds and hires people and administers sick leave and retirement mat¬ters. It is also concerned with compensation levels, professional devel¬opment, employee relations, and government regulations.
Information system for each of the above functions should enable the firm to handle information in respect of the function and support the operations in the function including decision making. So by knowing what goes on in a function, you could visualize what the information system for the function ought to facilitate.

                     <h5>Levels</h5>
The type of information required by decision makers in a company is directly related to the level of management decision making and the structure in the decision situations they face. The framework of the classic managerial pyramid applies even in today's downsized organizations and flattened or nonhierarchical organizational struc¬tures. Levels of management decision making still exist, but their size, shape, and participants continue to change as today's fluid organizational structures evolve. Thus, the levels of managerial decision making that must be supported by informa¬tion technology in a typical business organization are shown in the diagram and described as follows:













<li>Strategic Management</li>
Managers at this level make strategic (long tern) decisions and face unstructured (nonprogrammable) decisions. Thus they involve information with the following characteristics: ad hoc, unscheduled, summarized, infrequent, largely external, forward looking, and wide in scope.

<li>Operational Management</li>
Managers at this level at this level direct the performance of daily operations. They make structured (programmable) decisions. Thus they involve information with the following characteristics: scheduled, detailed, frequent, historical, internal, narrow focus.

<li>Tactical Management</li>
Managers at this level make tactical decisions.  They break long term plans (from strategic management) into implementable programs and use report (from transactions processed in low level management) for control and they face semi structured (partially programmable-partially non-programmable) decisions. Thus they involve information whose characteristics encompass those of the top and low level management levels.
Decision making
Decision making may consist of four stages as follows: intelligence, design, choice, and implementation.

Intelligence; consists of identifying and understanding the problems occurring in the organization—why the problem, where, and with what effects. Traditional MIS systems that deliver a wide variety of detailed information can help identify problems, especially if the sys¬tems report exceptions. 
Design: during solution design, possible resolutions to the problems are developed. Smaller DSS systems are ideal in this stage of decision making because they operate on simple mod¬els, can be developed quickly, and can be operated with limited data.

Choice; consists of selecting from among solution alternatives. Here the decision maker might need a larger DSS system to develop more extensive data on a variety of alternatives and complex models or data analysis tools to account for all of the costs, consequences, and opportunities.

Implementation; during solution implementation, when the decision is put into effect, managers can use a reporting system that delivers routine reports on the progress of a specific solution. Support systems can range from full-blown MIS systems to much smaller systems, as well as project-planning software operating on personal computers.
The stages of decision making do not necessarily follow a linear path. At any point in the decision-making process, you may have to loop back to a previous stage. One can be in the process of implementing a decision, only to discover that it is not working. In such a case, one is forced to repeat the design or choice stage.
Decisions made tend to differ according to managerial levels. Decisions made at the operational management level tend to be more structured, those at the tactical level more semitructured, and those at the strategic management level more unstructured. Structured decisions involve situations where the procedures to fol¬low when a decision is needed can be specified in advance. The inventory reorder decisions faced by most businesses are a typical example.
Unstructured decisions involve decision situations where it is not possible to specify in advance most of the decision procedures to follow. At most, many decision situations are semistructured. That is, some decision procedures can be prespecified, but not enough to lead to a definite recommended decision. For example, decisions involved in starting a new line of E-commerce services or making major changes to employee benefits would prob¬ably range from unstructured to semistructured. 
Types of information systems
Conceptually, the applications of information systems in the real world can be clas-sified in several different ways. For example, several types of information systems can be classified as either operations or management information systems. Given the managerial levels and the decision structures or situations (hence the characteristics of information needed in the levels) and functions (with the activities that have to be performed), we can classify information systems as shown in the diagram and described as follows:


 

<li> Operations support systems</li>
Operations support systems produce a variety of information products for internal and external use. However, they do not empha¬size producing the specific information products that can best be used by managers. Further processing by management information systems is usually required. The role of a business firm's operations support systems is to efficiently process business trans¬actions, control industrial processes, support enterprise communications and collab¬oration, and update corporate databases.  These systems are therefore divided into the following systems:
 Transaction processing systems: These systems are an important example of operations sup¬port systems that record and process data resulting from business transactions. They process transactions in two basic ways. In batch processing, transactions data are accu¬mulated over a period of time and processed periodically. In real-time (or online) processing, data are processed immediately after a transaction occurs. Examples: sales and inventory processing and accounting systems.
 
<li>Process control systems:</li> These systems monitor and control physical processes. For example, a petroleum refinery uses electronic sensors linked to computers to continually mon¬itor chemical processes and make instant (real-time) adjustments that control the refinery process. 

<li>Enterprise collaboration systems:</li> These systems enhance team and workgroup communications and productivity, and are sometimes called office automation systems. For example, knowledge workers in a project team may use electronic mail to send and receive electronic messages, and videoconferencing to hold electronic meetings to coordinate their activities. These systems support team, workgroup, and enterprise communications and collaboration. Examples include e-mail, chat, and videoconferencing groupware systems.

<li>Management support systems</li>
When information system applications focus on providing information and support for effective decision making by managers, they are called management support systems. Providing information and support for decision making by all types of managers and business professionals is a complex task. Conceptually, several major types of information systems support a variety of decision-making responsibilities: (1) management information systems, (2) decision support systems, and (3) execu¬tive information systems. 
<li>Management information system:</li>  These systems provide information in the form of pre-specified reports and displays to managers and many business professionals. For example, sales man¬agers may use their networked computers and Web browsers to get instantaneous displays about the sales results of their products and to access their corporate intranet for daily sales analysis reports that evaluate sales made by each salesperson. Other examples include production performance, and cost trend reporting systems.
Management Information systems were the original type of information system developed to support managerial decision making. An MIS produces information products that support many of the day-to-day decision-making needs of managers and business professionals. Management information systems provide a variety of information products to managers. Four major reporting alternatives are provided by such systems.
•	Periodic Scheduled Reports. This traditional form of providing information to managers uses a prespecified format designed to provide managers with information on a regular basis. Typical examples of such periodic scheduled reports are daily or weekly sales analysis reports and monthly financial statements.
•	Exception Reports. In some cases, reports are produced only when excep¬tional conditions occur. In other cases, reports are produced periodically but contain information only about these exceptional conditions. For example, a credit manager can be provided with a report that contains only information on customers who exceed their credit limits. Exception reporting reduces information overload, instead of overwhelming decision makers with periodic detailed reports of business activity.
•	Demand Reports and Responses. Information is available whenever a man¬ager demands it. For example, Web browsers and DBMS query languages and report generators enable managers at PC workstations to get immediate responses or find and obtain customized reports as a result of their requests for the information they need. Thus, managers do not have to wait for peri¬odic reports to arrive as scheduled.
•	Push Reporting. Information is pushed to a manager's networked workstation. Many companies are using webcasting software to selectively broadcast reports and other information to the networked PCs of managers and specialists over their corporate intranets.
<li>Deci¬sion support system:</li> These systems give direct computer support to managers during the decision-making process. For example, advertising managers may use an electronic spreadsheet program to do what-if analysis as they test the impact of alternative advertising budgets on the forecasted sales of new products. 
Decision support systems are computer-based information systems that provide interactive information support to managers and business professionals during the decision-making process. Decision support systems use (1) analytical models, (2) spe-cialized databases, (3) a decision maker's own insights and judgments, and (4) an interactive, computer-based modeling process to support the making of semistructured and unstructured business decisions.
A DSS model base is a software component that consists of models used in computational and analytical routines that mathematically express relationships among variables. A DSS model base could include models and analytical techniques used to express relationships. For example, it might contain linear programming models, multiple regression fore¬casting models, and capital budgeting present value models. Such models may be stored in the form of spreadsheet models or templates, or statistical and mathematical programs and program modules.
DSS software packages can combine model components to create integrated models that support specific types of decisions. DSS software typically contains built-in analytical modeling routines and also enables you to build your own mod¬els. Many DSS packages are now available in microcomputer and Web-enabled ver¬sions. Of course, electronic spreadsheet packages also provide some of the model building (spreadsheet models) and analytical modeling (what-if and goal-seeking analysis) offered by more power¬ful DSS software.  Among the applications of DSS is what if analysis.
In what-if analysis, an end user makes changes to variables, or relationships among variables, and observes the resulting changes in the values of other variables. For example, if you were using a spreadsheet, you might change a revenue amount (a variable) or a tax rate formula (a relationship among variables) in a simple financial spreadsheet model. Then you could command the spreadsheet program to instantly recalculate all affected variables in the spreadsheet. 

Every DSS consists of at least data management, model management components, user interface, and end users. A few advanced DSSs also contain a knowledge management component. 

Executive information systems. These systems provide critical information from many sources tailored to the information needs of executives. Examples: systems for easy access to analyses of business performance, actions of competitors, and economic developments to support strategic planning. Executive information systems (EIS) are information systems that combine many of the features of management information systems and decision support systems. When they were first developed, their focus was on meeting the strategic informa¬tion needs of top management. Thus, the first goal of executive information systems was to provide top executives with immediate and easy access to information about a firm's critical success factors (CSFs), that is, key factors that are critical to accom¬plishing an organization's strategic objectives. For example, the executives of a retail store chain would probably consider factors such as its E-commerce versus tradi¬tional sales results, or its product line mix to be critical to its survival and success.  EIS could also be used in answering question such as what business should we be in, what are the competitors doing? Etc.  It consists of workstations with menus, interactive graphics and communications capabilities that can access historical and competitive data from internal corporate systems and external sources.

Executive information systems are becoming so widely used by managers, analysts, and other knowledge workers that they are sometimes humorously called "everyone's information systems." More popular alternative names are enterprise information systems (EIS) and executive support systems (ESS). These names also reflect the fact that more features, such as Web browsing, electronic mail, groupware tools, and DSS and expert system capabilities, are being added to many systems to make them more useful to managers and business professionals.

The terms executive information system and executive support system mean different things to different people, though they are sometimes used interchangeably. The difference might be seen as follows:

An EIS is a computer-based system that serves the information needs of top executives. It provides rapid access to timely information and direct access to management reports. An EIS is very user friendly, is supported by graphics, and provides the capabilities of exception reporting (reporting of only the results that deviate from a set standard) and drill down (investigating information in increasing detail). It is also easily connected with online information services and electronic mail.

An ESS is a comprehensive support system that goes beyond EIS to include analysis support, communications, office automation, and intelligence support. The following components exist in an expert system: knowledge base, inference engine, blackboard (workplace), user interface, and explanation subsystem (justifier). In the future, systems will include a knowledge-refining component. 

Other categories of information systems

One of the most practical and widely implemented applications of artificial intelli¬gence in business is the development of expert systems and other knowledge-based information systems. A knowledge-based information system (KBIS) adds a knowledge base to the major components found in other types of computer-based information systems. An expert system (ES) is a knowledge-based information system that uses its knowledge about a specific, complex application area to act as an expert consultant to end users. Expert systems provide answers to questions in a very specific problem area by making humanlike inferences about knowledge contained in a specialized knowledge base. They must also be able to explain their reasoning process and con-clusions to a user. So expert systems can provide decision support to end users in the form of advice from an expert consultant in a specific problem area.  In reality they provide expert advice and act as expert consultants to users. Examples include credit application advisor, process monitor, and diagnostic maintenance systems.
The components of an expert system include a knowledge base and software mod¬ules that perform inferences on the knowledge and communicate answers to a user's questions.
The knowledge base of an expert system contains<li> (1) facts about a specific subject area (for example, John is an analyst) </li> (2) heuristics (rules of thumb) that express the reasoning procedures of an expert on the subject (for example: IF John is an analyst, THEN he needs a workstation).
An expert system software package contains an inference engine and other programs for refining knowledge and communicating with users. The inference engine program processes the knowledge (such as rules and facts) related to a specific problem. It then makes associations and infer¬ences resulting in recommended courses of action for a user. User interface programs for communicating with end users are also needed, including an explanation program to explain the reasoning process to a user if requested.
Using an expert system involves an interactive computer-based session in which the solution to a problem is explored, with the expert system acting as a consultant to an end user. The expert system asks questions of the user, searches its knowledge base for facts and rules or other knowledge, explains its reasoning process when asked, and gives expert advice to the user in the subject area being explored.
Expert systems are being used for many different types of applications. Expert systems now help diagnose illnesses, search for minerals, analyze com¬pounds, recommend repairs, and do financial planning. From a strategic business standpoint, expert systems can and are being used to improve every step of the prod¬uct cycle of a business, from finding customers to shipping products to providing customer service.

Knowledge management systems. Knowledge-based systems that support the creation, organization, and dissemination of business knowledge within the enterprise. Examples include intranet access to best business practices, sales proposal strategies, and customer problem resolution systems.
Strategic information systems. Support operations or management processes that provide a firm with strategic-products, services, and capabilities for competitive advantage. Examples include online stock trading, shipment tracking, and E-commerce Web systems.
Functional business systems. Support a variety of operational and managerial applications of the basic business functions of a company. Examples include information systems that support applications in accounting, finance, marketing, operations management, and human resource management.

Cross-Functional business systems
Integration of the enterprise has emerged as a critical issue for organizations in all business sectors striving to maintain competitive advantage. It has been used to develop integrated cross-functional enterprise systems that cross the boundaries of traditional business functions.  In addition many firms have moved to integrated cross-functional client-server applications.  This involved installing enterprise resource planning (ERP), supply chain management (SCM), or customer relationship management (CRM) systems.

Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) System
ERP is a cross-functional enterprise system that serves as a framework to integrate and automate many of the business processes that must be accomplished within the manufacturing, logistics, distribution, accounting, finance, and human resources function.
Supply Chain Management (SCM) Systems
Supply chain management integrates supplier, distributor, and customer logistics re-quirements into one cohesive process. The supply chain is a collection of entities, such as man-ufacturing plants, distribution centers, conveyances, retail outlets, people, and information that are linked through processes such as procurement or logistics to supply goods and services from source through consumption. Goods or services start out as raw materials and move through the company's logistics and production systems until they reach customers. To manage the supply chain, a company tries to eliminate delays and cut the amount of resources tied up along the way. Information systems make supply chain management more efficient by integrating de¬mand planning, forecasting, materials requisition, order processing, inventory allocation, order fulfillment, transportation services, receiving, invoicing, and payment. Supply chain manage¬ment can not only lower inventory costs but also can create efficient customer response systems that deliver the product or service more rapidly to the customer.

In managing supply chains, IT provides two major types of software solutions for managing—planning, organizing, coordinating, and controlling—supply chain activities. First is enterprise resource planning (ERP) software, which helps in managing both the internal and the external relationships with the business partners. Second is supply chain management (SCM) software, which helps in decision making related both to internal segments and to their relationships with external segments.

Customer Relationship Management (CRM) Systems
CRM uses IT to create a cross-functional enterprise system that integrates and automates many of the customer-serving processes in sales, marketing, and product services that interact with a firm’s customers. Included are tracking customer contacts, response managing, and helping customers with product use etc. CRM recognizes that customers are the core of a business and that a company’s success depends on effectively managing relationships with them. CRM focuses on building long-term and sustainable customer relationships that add value both for the customer and the company. CRM has had very many definitions. The reason is that CRM is new and still evolving. Also, it is an interdisciplinary field, so each discipline (e.g., marketing, management) defines CRM differently. CRM requires a customer-centric business philosophy and culture to support effective marketing, sales and services processes.

Major types of CRM activities include: operational, analytical, and collaborative. Operational CRM is related to typical business functions involving customer services, order management, invoice/billing, and sales/marketing automation and management. Analytical CRM involves activities that capture, store, extract, process, interpret, and report customer data to a user, who then analyzes them as needed. Collaborative CRM deals with all the necessary communication, coordination, and collaboration between vendors and customers.
